# Vercel Deployment Instructions

1. Place all your static files (e.g., HTML, JS, CSS, images) in the `public` directory.
2. The `vercel.json` is configured to serve files from `public`.
3. Deploy using the Vercel CLI or by connecting your repository to Vercel.

## Example Vercel CLI Commands

```sh
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

---

You can now move `admin-combined.html` and any other static assets into the `public` folder for deployment.
